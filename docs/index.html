        TinyCanvas is a simple canvas implementation in Go, built with TinyGo.
        It has a wasm-side canvas it can render to an HTML Canvas element on
        demand. The idea is to have a device-agnostic "engine" that can be used
        to render to various graphic targets. For now, only the web is
        supported, but it could in theory work on other devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea was born out of the need to port some Turbo Pascal graphics
        code to the web and in many modern graphics libraries, the concept of
        "putpixel" is not always simple and easy to use. I needed this as well
        as some building blocks like lines, blocks and circles, so it turned
        into a bit of a project. Eventually I thought I'd make the code
        available to anyone who's run into the same challenge and is better at
        searching than I am!
