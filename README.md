# TinyCanvas
TinyGo bindings to use the HTML5 Canvas - convenience utility basically for myself.

===
All of this is still very much WIP.

## Canvas
Contains the canvas components.

## Demo
Houses a very small, simple demo.

## Zed
I use <https://zed.dev/> as my main editor most of the time. There's a convenient `zed.sh`
file included to start it with the right environment variables to enable code completion etc.
